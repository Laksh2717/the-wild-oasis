- the id field in cabins and guests table are normal keys, while cabinId and guestId in bookings table are foriegn keys.

- know about RLS policies. 

- now you can refer to api docs for connecting supabase with react.

- npm i @supabase/supabase-js

- make supabase.js file. 

- for testing purpose, create a function getCabins in Cabin page, and you will see that it is working perfectly fine.
